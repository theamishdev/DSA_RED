# 🧠 DSA_RED

Welcome to **DSA_RED**, a curated collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** solutions written in **C++**.  
This repository is built to help in mastering core algorithmic concepts through clean and efficient implementations.

## 📘 About the Repository

- Contains **solutions only (Solution class)** — no `main()` function included.  
- Each file corresponds to a specific DSA problem.  
- Solutions are written in **C++**, following optimal and readable coding practices.  
- All problems are organized and tracked through the **Notion workspace** linked below.
